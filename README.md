This is a project for WebTechnology CW2. Student id: 00016121.

For developing a simple webapp for my CW, I used Express.js/Node.js frameworks. The basic functionality consists of 4 main steps.
Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting the data from the database. I implemented all of these functionalities in my webapp.

I have made the UI (front-end) look minimalistic and pleasent, and gave it a soft orange background. 
The project structure is quite simple. I have created seperate folders for:
controllers
data
public
routes
services
validators
views

and some additional scripts such as app.js for the main script, packages
and .gitignore


To run the application we should write some commands:

npm install
node app


Application dependicies:
Exspress.js
Pug template engine
Express validation
